# Bayesian-bandit-adaptive-n-of-1

This repository contains code for our paper on Bayesian-bandit adaptive design for aggregated N-of-1
clinical trials. Example1.R and Example2.R can be run for our simulation examples. The external file containing the Stan model should be in the same directory as the source code while running the examples.
